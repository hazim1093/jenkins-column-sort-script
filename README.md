Create a link to the script using jsDeliver: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hazim1093/jenkins-column-sort-script/sort-column.js
Specify this in the "javascript" for Simple theme plugin for jenkins. 

#### Note
This is a hardcoded script, and will work with jenkins having active tab named "Recent", and will sort the 5th column until it is sorted to latest first.
